Online Book Shop Page Overview
Our Book Shop page offers a range of convenient features to enhance your browsing and shopping experience:
‚Ä¢	Book Details & Availability: Each book comes with comprehensive details, including title, author, and price. Availability is clearly displayed to help you know which books are ready to order.
‚Ä¢	Add to Cart Button: Easily add your favorite books to the cart for a smooth and hassle-free checkout process.
‚Ä¢	Search & Sort by Category: Users can search for books by title or sort them according to categories like Novels, Translations, and Kids' Stories, making it easy to find exactly what you're looking for.
